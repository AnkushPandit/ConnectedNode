1. A spring boot application, with gardle as build
2. Clean code with javaDoc and following industry standard
3. To maintain the graph structure a union-find structure has been used which keeps track of connected components
4. Added unit tests for controller, handlers

To run local server (for windows) `gradlew.bat bootRun`
